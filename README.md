My entry for the GMTK Game Jam 2023. 
The theme for this jam is **Roles Reversed** which means you will be playing a role that you normally don't play.

As the theme suggests, in this game the roles have been reversed and you play as the boss enemy, a red fire breathing dragon with a single goal to defeat the hero.

Controls:
- Move left and right with **W/ D**
- Fly downwards faster with **S**
- Fly upwards with **SPACE**
- Breathe fire with **F** (NOTE: there is a cooldown for this action)

How to play:
The take control of the dragon starting on the left of the screen and naviage to 
your enemey the hero wearing a blue space suit. To defeat your enemy you need to 
be able to dodge enemy attacks and fight back using your fire breathing ability.
Your fire breathing cannot be used too frequently and you cannot move while
attacking so picking the right time to attack is the key to victory.
